Welcome to the 33rd Annual GIS Research UK Conference. The conference will be hosted at University of Bristol on 23rd – 25th April 2025.

GISRUK attracts international researchers and practitioners from geographic information science and related fields to share and discuss the latest advances in spatial computing and analysis. The work presented at GISRUK covers fundamental research, methodological approaches, and applications of GIScience across many domains.

We welcome papers covering all aspects of GIS, both methodological and applied. This year, we are particularly excited to invite submissions that investigate Process in Geographic Information Science, including innovations in causal inference, graphical modelling, or re-thinking the link between the patterns we see and what we represent on our computer screens.
